| divest                   | this list (no.851)            | Example just reads _Droll_ for some reason. Either delete or replace with good example.

| baseness                 | GRE Test exam 1               | pretty logical in what it means, maybe include it since it's not a negation of _abasement_ and it could be easily be confused as being one?                                                                                                                                                           |
| judicious                | GRE Test exam 1               | has nothing to do with law, could confuse if looking at it from a logical side                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| doctrinaire              | GRE Test exam 1               | Maybe leave it out, seems a bit self-explanatory                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
