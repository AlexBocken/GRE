| excise                   | Prep-scholar                  | Came up in _Analyzing text structure & purpose (Core Verbal)_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| deprecate/depreciate     | this list (no.203)            | Use an example with the other meaning of _deprecate_, not the software meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| blight                   | this list (no.110)            | missing </b> at the end of example                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| divest                   | this list (no.851)            | Example just reads _Droll_ for some reason. Either delete or replace with good example. (pretty easy word though)                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| capacity                 | this list (no.133)            | missing </b> & </u> in example.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| eddy                     | this list (no.854)            | better example: _<u>Leonardo Da Vinci</u> could apply his <u>research into eddys</u> to the main <u>aorta</u>'s valve closing mechanism centuries before modern science proved his theories to be correct_ (maybe not specific, but something that helps me personally remember the word really well) |
| effect/affect            | this list (no.260)            | either pin down underlines in example or remove, underlining everything seems redundant.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
